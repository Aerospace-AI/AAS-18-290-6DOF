# Note you may need to run several optimizations to achieve results comparable to that in the paper
## virtual environment should include:
### Tensorflow 
### Python 3.5
### Matplotlib 2.1.1  (newer versions mess up the plotting in notebook)
### Scipy
### scikit-learn
### jupyter

### 1.) Download this repository
### 2.) cd to Run/Run_4km_terminal
### 3.) open jupyter from the virtual environment
### 4.) run the notebook
